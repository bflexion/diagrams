## Terraform module diagrams

Resize core AWS component (e.g. S3 bucket for the s3_bucket module) to larger dimension of 60pt. Subsidiary
resources should be resized to a larger dimension of 40pt. The diagram should be contained in an AWS
Account, AWS Region, or combination of these as appropriate to indicate the module's regionality.

## Terraform module library icons

Recolour AWS icon for key resource to match, copy the Terraform logo flash from one of the other images (may
need to ungroup first).
